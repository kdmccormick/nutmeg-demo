<p>As of Nutmeg, the <strong>library_sourced</strong> block type is an experimental way of including library content from V2 (blockstored-based) libraries into modulestore-based courses. It is not officially supported and may be removed at some point in favor of a different implementation. However, it's good that we include it in this course, because it is a good way of smoke-testing the blockstore-based library backend, which is used in some production environments.</p>
