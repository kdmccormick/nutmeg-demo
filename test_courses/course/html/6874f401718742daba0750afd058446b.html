<p>The <strong>staffgradedxblock</strong> block type is installed by the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/staff_graded-xblock/blob/master/staff_graded/staff_graded.py" target="[object Object]"><strong>staff_graded-xblock </strong>repo</a> and presented as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Staff Graded Points<strong>.</strong></span> Notably and confusingly, this is distinct from <a href="https://github.com/mitodl/edx-sga" target="[object Object]">MIT's <strong>edx_sga </strong>block type</a>, which is presented as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Staff Graded Assignment</span>. </p>
<p>(It seems like <strong>staffgradedblock</strong> doesn't provide a template by default, so I haven't gotten a chance to add it here yet. Contributors, please feel free to add one.)</p>
